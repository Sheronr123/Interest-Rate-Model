Interest rates are modelled by Orstein Uhlenbeck process which relies heavily on Wiener process where the increments are normally distributed mean is 0 & the variance is dt, having continous path and independant values from the past. 

This model also takes the form of the stochastic model however this is stationary. However with this model, we have theta which is the long term mean of the interest rate and kappa which is the speed of mean reversion. 

In simpler examples we used a constant interest rate to work out the present value but now we can use stochastic change and substitute into the continuous model.
